# Content

* Return Status Prediction:

Predicting product return status with Random Forest Classifier model.
The success of the model is measured using features such as Quantity, UnitPrice, Discount, ShippingCost and the accuracy of the model is evaluated with accuracy score and classification report.

* Data Analysis and Visualization:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Information about the general structure of the data is provided by summarizing the data.

Statistical Summary: Basic statistical summaries of the data, distributions and correlations for numerical variables were analyzed.

Visualizations: Various visualizations were made for a better understanding of the data:

Categorical and Numerical Data: Distribution of data by sales channels and payment methods, visualization of sales and profit by each category.

Return Status and Sales Channels: Bar charts visualizing the relationship between return status by sales channels.

Sales and Net Profit by Year and Month: The change in sales and net profits over time by year and month are plotted.

Word Cloud: WordCloud was created to visualize the most common words in product descriptions.
